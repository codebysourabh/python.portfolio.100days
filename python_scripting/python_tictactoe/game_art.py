Welcome to Text-based Tic Tac Toe!

Objective:
The objective of the game is to get three of your marks ('X' or 'O') in a row
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3x3 game board.

Game Board:
The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid is identified
by its row and column numbers. Players will input these numbers to make their moves.

  1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
  4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
  7 | 8 | 9

Player Turns:
1. Player 1, you will be 'X', and Player 2 will be 'O'.
2. Players take turns to make a move.
3. On your turn, enter the number of the cell where you want to place your mark.

Making a Move:
- When it's your turn, enter the number of the cell where you want to place your mark ('X' or 'O').
- The cell numbers are as follows:

  1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
  4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
  7 | 8 | 9

- For example, if you want to place your mark in the center, type '5' and press Enter.

Winning the Game:
The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally), or when the entire board is filled without a winner.

Gameplay Tips:
- Pay attention to your opponent's moves and plan your strategy accordingly.
- Think strategically to block your opponent and create opportunities for your own victory.

Enjoy the game, and may the best player win!
