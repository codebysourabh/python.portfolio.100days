# Text Based Tic Tac Toe

## Objective: Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game.

### Algorythim i'll be using to build this is:
- Create a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
- Initialize the board with empty spaces.
- Display the initial empty board.
- Repeat the following steps until the game is over:
    - Player 1 makes a move:
        - Prompt Player 1 to enter the row and column (1, 2, or 3) where - they want to place their 'X'.
        - Update the board with 'X' at the specified position.
        - Display the updated board.
        - Check if Player 1 has won or if the board is full. If true, - end the game.
    - b. Player 2 makes a move:
        - Prompt Player 2 to enter the row and column (1, 2, or 3) where - they want to place their 'O'.
        - Update the board with 'O' at the specified position.
        - Display the updated board.
        - Check if Player 2 has won or if the board is full. If true, - end the game.

If the game ends with a winner, declare the winner. If the game ends in a tie, declare a tie.
